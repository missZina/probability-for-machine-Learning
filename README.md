# probability-for-machine-Learning
Probability and statistics are related areas of mathematics which concern themselves with analyzing the relative frequency of events.


Probability is a measure of uncertainty. Probability applies to machine learning because in the real world, we need to make decisions with incomplete information.
Hence, we need a mechanism to quantify uncertainty â€“ which Probability provides us. Using probability, we can model elements of uncertainty such as risk in financial
transactions and many other business processes. In contrast, in traditional programming, we work with deterministic problems i.e. the solution is not affected by uncertainty.
